# Feature-Extraction-using-AlexNet
 This code is used to extract features using AlexNet.
# Steps involved
 1. Initially, the image datastore is being read.
 2. Then, all the images are preprocessed.
 3. Select pre-trained D-CNN, i.e., AlexNet, in this case.
 4. Define the layer on which you want to extract features in this case, it is selected as "FC7".
 5. Extract features and store them in a variable.
# Purpose
This code can extract features using AlexNet for any image dataset. These features can later be used to train any machine learning classifier.
